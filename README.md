# Zach Lowe Article Monitor

Summary: Scrape Zach Lowe's Twitter Feed for articles he has tweeted, then traverses those webpages to get metadata about the article name and description.

## Background

In my opinion, Zach Lowe is by far the best sportswriter on the internet. He writes for ESPN.com (sadly...), and ESPN does not provide RSS feeds for their individual writers. This means the easiest way to find new Lowe articles is to check Twitter constantly, and then follow the link to the original article. A better solution would be to have an RSS feed of Zach Lowe's work, so that I could integrate it into my existing feed reader and not have to visit Twitter every time.

## To Do
* Bring over full article content, not just title, description, and link.
* Host the RSS feed somewhere.
